        <v-card-text>I am a Spanish Ux/Ui Designer, a Polytechnic University of Valencia artist graduate and a
          horticulture enthusiast.

          I work with different principles and methods like the ‘Design Process Thinking’ or the ‘Crazy 8’. Always
          aiming
          to achieve -as Jared Spool would say- an invisible design that helps and attracts users.

          If you would like to get in touch, please message me on LinkedIn or by email at gloriarossi@pm.me; And don’t
          hesitate on checking my Dribbble and Medium accounts.
